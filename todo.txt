TODO:
watchdog:
    integration -- get upload functionality to work
        looked like it didn't trigger a 'create' event so it never called upload when a new file was created

fake gui:
    command prompt 1110 style!
    login, admin stuff, commands, etc...

admin functions:
    using APPE to append to a file, create new users, and change passwords

same account on different computer:
    need to get this working, upload on one should download on another.
